# About
#### Hi, I am Junior Hutto, a GIS Specialist at NRCS.  I am keenly interested in tool scripts and GIS modeling and I thrive on learning and adapting. I am delving into Python, ArcPy, PostGIS, Home Labs, and anything else that captures my curiosity, always open to new ideas and technologies.   You can reach me at franklin.hutto@usda.gov for any professional discussions.
