# About
Hi, I am interested in Regenerative Agriculture, and GIS applications.  
## Goal
Just Junior integrates software development with regenerative agriculture. 
## Bio
An Illinois native and Oklahoma State alumnus, I bring a unique perspective shaped by 20 years of dairy farming followed by 20 years as a GIS Consultant.
## Plan
My approach is rooted in practical problem-solving: I identify systemic challenges within regenerative agriculture and develop custom software solutions to address them.
## Summary
My background in animal agriculture, geography, and sustainable food production gives me a unique and valuable perspective.

**Have Fun!**
