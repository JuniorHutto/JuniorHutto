Hi, I am Junior Hutto, a GIS Specialist at NRCS.  I have a keen interest in tool scripts and GIS modeling,  and I am constantly learning and adapting. Currently, I am delving into Python, ArcPy, PostGIS, Home Labs, and anything else that captures my curiosity.   You can reach me at jr@hutto.io for any professional discussions.
